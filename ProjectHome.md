Cladograms are diagrams used in Phylogenetics to indicate evolutionary relationships.

Wikipedia uses a Clade template to produce Cladograms with clickable nodes. It is however not easy for many editors to create cladograms.

This simple Windows utility allows the editing of Cladograms using a tree control. The application is written in Visual C++ 2005 and is based on an open licensed code by Yossi Patt on CodeProject http://www.codeproject.com/KB/tree/TreeEditorPackage.aspx
